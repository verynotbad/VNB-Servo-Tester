Using an Arduino UNO, create a interactive device that can test hobby servos, let you calibrate your servo's microcontroller code (e.g. Arduino Sketches) by helping you find the minimum and maximum Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) settings, and even display the internal position of the servo (if your servo is equipped with an analog feedback line).  This project also has instructions and models for 3D Printing an enclosure for your device, letting you create a tool that no makerspace should be without.
